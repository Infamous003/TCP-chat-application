# TCP-chat-application

## A simple CLI based chat application using sockets

This CLI based application uses a simple client-server architecture for communication. Used the socket module. It uses TCP to establish the connection before communicating. More features will be added soon. Currently working on this project...

## How to setup this on your system

It's simple, clone this repository on your system and run the code.
Make sure to run the server.py file first followed by client.py. This is necessary since the client needs a server to connect to, before communicating.
